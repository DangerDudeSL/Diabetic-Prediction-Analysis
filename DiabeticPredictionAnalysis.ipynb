The AI technique used can vary from scenario to scenario for instance Machine learning techniques like regression and decision trees can be used for anomaly detection and predictive analysis for diseases.  For instance, the Apple Watch’s electrocardiogram (ECG) feature uses AI to identify atrial fibrillation, helping prevent strokes.\n",
        "Remote patient monitoring (RPM) systems further aid from AI. Systems like LIVONGO utilize machine learning techniques, reinforcement learning and NLP to provide personalized feedback to patients with chronic conditions, such as diabetes and hypertension. AI ensures patients receive timely care, particularly in underserved or remote areas, which can be impossible or expensive in traditional ways. This also reduces the burden on traditional healthcare infrastructure.\n"
